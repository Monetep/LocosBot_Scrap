The 2018 Comic Exhibition took place in Tapei last week and among the various toys and collectibles on offer were a selection of figurines based on SNK's King of Fighters series.Iori Yagami, Kyo Kusanagi and the always-welcome Mai Shiranui are the three characters who have been immortalised in 1/8 and 1/6 scale figures by manufacturer Gantaku. All the figurines on display feature colourful, translucent flame effects and feature the veteran characters dynamically posing in their classic outfits.Also on display was the prototype of a a two figure diorama, featuring longtime foes Iori and Kyo going head-to head in battle, wearing their modern outfits from the excellent King of Fighters XIV. The models are available for pre-order now from various outlets. Classic Kyo and Iori will retail for around $160 each, but the 1/6 Mai statue is limited to a run of 1500 and will set you back a much heftier $550. Yikes.The King of Fighters XIV is available now on PS4 and PC.|https://www.destructoid.com/|No Leona love...|Gantaku's King of Fighters XIV figurine range includes Kyo, Iori and Mai Shiranui
World of Warcraft might not have the same cultural cache it once had in an era filled with multi-million player free-to-play MMOs, but at this point it's most definitely an institution.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
The fact is, Blizzard has maintained the project for nearly 14 years with a subscription-based service. All around them they saw the vast majority of their competition move to free-to-play, yet they remained steadfast. Its seventh expansion promises to get back to basics in a sense, but it's also indicative of where it could go from here.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth (PC)Developer: BlizzardPublisher: BlizzardReleased: August 14, 2018MSRP: $49.99|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
"Some people see the all out war narrative shift in World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth to be reductive, especially after the ""both sides working together"" concept was going somewhere, but I'm not so sure about that. While the Orcs vs. Humans angle is trumped up to a silly degree, particularly for advertisement's sake, I do actually see it going somewhere and I envision a future where I'm looking back at the events of this expansion wistfully."|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
A lot of major characters have died to get here, and quite a few big names are involved in the events of the story that's unraveling right now. Based on my experience so far I'm hopeful that it'll justify its existence, though I'm not as immediately as enamored as I was with Legion. Part of that is because I was so attached to the idea of fighting the Burning Legion once and for all and playing my ideal class -- Demon Hunter. But it also just felt more pressing from the start, whereas Battle is more of a slower ramping up.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
Even still Blizzard is bringing all the tricks of the trade that they've learned to date and have once again nailed the solo experience. Beginning with my Horde Blood Elf Demon Hunter I found myself in a mess of a prison break in Stormwind, which played out like a miniature dungeon to the tune of a heist-focused action movie. Eventually that focus is widened, coupled by numerous cutscenes that help alleviate the questing process.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
Battle sees both sides sailing across various [new] bits of Azeroth in search of allies, which takes both the Alliance and Horde to new lore-heavy locales -- Kul Tiras (homeland of Jaina) for the former and Zandalar, troll land, for the latter. Because of the mystery surrounding these places it allows for Blizzard to get a little creative with them, with plenty of out-there concepts like dinosaurs and pirates.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
Seeing as this is the crux of Battle's new content it's very important that it shines, and currently I'm at odds with it. We've seen many of the same themes (pirates and dinosaurs were even in Vanilla WoW), but the slight differences like non-Naga snake men (Sethrak) on top of the Naga, with their own stories differentiate it enough from what Blizzard has done in the past. The new worlds are also some of Blizzard's best, most detailed work yet -- some of the best in the entire MMO sphere actually. The Necropolis at Zandalar is a sight to behold in photos, but even more awe-inspiring in motion, and the music is worthy of being a part of any film score. It does kindle the desire to do it all twice: once more with one of my Alliance characters (despite some crisscrossing). I haven't felt like that about an expansion in a long while.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
"On the less emotional side the Artifact weapon system has been reworked into an amulet called ""The Heart of Azeroth."" This is basically your ""leveling beyond the cap"" doodad, and is a little more manageable given that amulets/accessories have always had a less exciting feel to them when they drop. It links up with armor to provide new abilities, and right now it's not in the way at all or super important; so expect more thoughts later down the line."|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
Blizzard seems to finally have figured out a way to appease fans who both adore and oppose world PVP. Me? I think they could have allowed free transfers off of world PVP servers for people who didn't realize what they signed up for -- a thriving world PVP system on marked servers helped make World of Warcraft that much more exciting -- but maybe that's too big an ask. Now in Battle for Azeroth you can head to either Stormwind or Orgrimmar (Alliance or Horde respectively) to toggle world PVP, which increases quest rewards/experience by 10% and unlocks PVP talents to use out in the wild.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
The result, especially during the leveling stages (the best time to world PVP) is that a lot of folks aren't playing with it enabled. And why would they? Now is the time when people are taking off work and trying to level their character for endgame: not get caught up in dust-ups. I turned it on before the expansion even hit (in part so I could write about it, in part because I'm such an old guard guy) and I'm basically coming across crickets. It's such a non-issue that you can even bury the PVP talent and toggle section entirely by pressing an arrow and forget it exists forever. I'm anxious to see if that changes as time goes on.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth
As I've already expressed I'm not sure how I feel about Battle for Azeroth yet. In some ways it's a step down from Legion but after all these years I'm still excited to play World of Warcraft, so it's doing its job. This assessment is based on three weeks of messing around with the pre-patch features and a heap of expansion play (both prior betas and the live version), but I haven't scratched the surface yet. Stay tuned for a future full review of World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth after I reach the level cap and play around with its endgame.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Orcs vs. Humans|Review in Progress: World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth

I have a nephew who, in two weeks time, will be starting his freshman year in high school. The thought of that makes me feel fucking old but it also gets me thinking about my time in school. I loved school, going to class and hitting the books. The only problem was there were always other people around. People are the worst and high schoolers are the worst of the worst. I wish my nephew luck. These are about to be the most awkward years of his life. We all know that from our own experiences and the many, many video games that have been released over the years set in a high school. |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
Most of them are JRPGs, but for years gamers have had to endure the social constructs of high school while battling demons, exploring dungeons, or whatever other crazy quests developers tasked us with. In honor of back to school season, I asked my fellow Destructoid writers to name the video game school they wish they could have attended. Or maybe will be able to attend in some Never Been Kissed/21 Jump Street situation. After spending a few days in my thinking spot, I realized the most obvious answer to this question is Cool School High. |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
What? You’ve never heard of Cool School High? But it’s so cool, the word ‘cool’ is in its name and nothing says you’re cool like going out of your way to tell everyone that you’re cool. Cool School High is the setting of the forgotten NES... |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
What’s the opposite of gem? Dog? |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
Cool School High is the setting of the forgotten NES dog Ghoul School, where senior and punk rocker Spike O’Hara -- Ireland represent! -- has to save head cheerleader Samantha Pompom from demons and monsters that have taken over his school after Spike finds a haunted skull and brings it school. You know, that old story. Seriously, Samantha Pompom, Cool School High; if this game were any more 90s it’d come in Day-Glo packaging and include a coupon for $1.00 off a bottle of Sunny Delight. |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
So why Cool School High? Well, that haunted skull turned all the teachers and the football team in monstrous beasts I get to club to death with a baseball bat while wearing spring shoes. That’s pretty much what I pictured myself doing anyway any time I got a B on a math test.|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend

"So many video game schools are filled with students training to be adventurers or heroes, but not many exist for the other side of the fence. I'd normally jump on an opportunity to visit the former, but there is one example of a ""villain"" school I'd be happy to attend. Disgaea 3’s Evil Academy is dedicated to preparing its students to live in the Netherworld, which, given it kinda is a Netherworld itself, means that graduation is almost a guarantee that you’re set to succeed at that life. This already sounds way better than our American school system!"|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
Evil Academy’s curriculum is also much more practical and less pointlessly strenuous than real school. In fact, it practically doesn’t even exist!  The teachers all know better than to waste their time on classes students will never apply in real life (and also being “evil” means being lazy or something), so attending classes and doing homework is discouraged. Maybe that means studying has more appeal to punks, but I’m more interested in developing practical skills that will really shape my future. Like casting magic, or surviving gunshot wounds, or fulfilling my absurdly exaggerated power fantasies, or blogging about video games!|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
The one major downside -- aside from an abundance of bullies, which is a problem we’re still trying to solve in real schools anyway -- is only demons are allowed to attend. Meaning if I’m not born a demon, I’d have to die, get reincarnated into a Prinny, and swab a billion decks before I’d have the chance to enroll. But to drink the glass half full, that also means I’d eventually get a chance to reincarnate into a cool anime monster, like a mothman, or a dragon, or a mothman, or a wood golem, or maybe... a mothman. So, ya know what, it might still be a pretty cool opportunity in the end! I’d be in no hurry to start that process, though.|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
Peter Glagowski|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
"I can't say I've ever really thought about schools in video games. I wasn't really a good student and I basically hate everything to do with lectures, so I tend to just plow through school levels without a second thought. They are boring and bring up bad memories of high school. Still, one school that I wouldn't mind attending would be the ""Knight Academy"" from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword."|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
Not only do Link and Zelda both attend, but the rest of the student body is full of colorful characters. Groose becomes a loveable oaf, Fledge is a guy with confidence issues that hits very close to home, Karane is basically a reincarnation of Midna (from Twilight Princess) and Pipit is an asshole. There always needs to be an asshole, right?|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
I think the other thing that gets me is how the school is on an island in the sky. You can stroll over to the edge and look down on the world. It must be awesome to have that view every single day of your life. It would definitely make me more interested in P.E, that's for sure.|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
"Chris MoyseNot too many schools in video games spring to mind, obviously save for the one in Rockstar's excellent Bully but to talk about the digital school I've spent the most time in, we gotta go back a couple of decades, to a popular ZX Spectrum title. Released in 1985, David Reidy's Back to Skool saw Eric, a trouble-causing ruffian needing access to the safe of his headmaster, Mr. Whacker, so he can replace his less-than-gleaming school report with a fake. To do this, the player has to guide Eric through the world's longest school day, completing a series of lateral-thinking tasks in order to get into the staff room.The mechanic in Back to Skool, pretty revolutionary for the time, was that Eric also had to manage all the requirements of The Happiest Days of Your Life, including following class timetables, dealing with bullies and hanging out with your crush. Ducking classes, stealing bikes, dropping smoke bombs and unleashing critters in the girl's school were all part of Eric's master plan to avoid expulsion. In a fun touch, the game also allowed you to rename the entire cast, so kids could insert their own teachers and friends directly into the action.Back to Skool was innocent fun, far from the sociopathic war zone that was my real school life. Do you know we invented a series of ""hilarious"" moves that we performed on each other almost daily? Moves like ""Kidney Failure"", where we kicked each other hard in the back through that little hole in the desk chairs, or ""Take the Corner"", where if you saw someone idly leaning back on their chair, it was then your duty to sweep the supporting legs out from under them.Happiest Days of Your Life."|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend

This one is a bit of a cheat because the game was never released, but we can catch a few glimpses of it in video form. Project A-Ko is pretty much my all-time absurd teen action comedy anime film. A-Ko, the presumed daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, goes to school with a young woman who is physically identical to Kenshiro from Fight of the North Star, but that's no big deal. Things don't get really wild until B-Ko, a Lex Luthor-esque rich girl, brings giant robot suits of various sizes to battle A-Ko for the attention of C-Ko, A-Ko's brainless-but-adorable best friend. |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
It's almost entirely dude-free zone, filled with all the stuff that I loved as a teenage dude, and almost none of the stuff I didn't love (namely, other teenage dudes). A-Ko built my hotrod and if I were her, I'd go to school seven days a week without complaint. |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend

If we're being honest, I wouldn't mind going to one of the Persona schools, if only for the way they perfectly capture the stereotype of a tranquil anime high school, but I'd also be down with attending Danganronpa's Hope's Peak Academy. |https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend

At first, I thought I was going to answer Bullworth Academy, home of such esteemed alumni as Jimmy Hopkins, and the center of creative school hijinks and borderland violent psychopaths. But I can't deny myself everything that I am currently feeling right now. I am knee deep in Monster Hunter hype, so what's available for me? The Hunter's Guild is more of an association for skilled laborers, but you know what's still left for me to flexibly adapt as a school? The Wycademy, that's what.|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
The Wycademy is an organization devoted to the study and understanding of ancient monsters, fossils, and extinct species. It's basically a school for paleontologists, and the discipline of course includes the study of currently living specimens as well. After all, what better way to study the past than by studying the present? And while the Wycademy is filled with proper students, its also staffed by properly licensed hunters who also happen to be Wycademy scholars. And while yes, it'd be cool to say I'm a licensed hunter, who is also apart of a unionize agreement between the guild and wild felynes to be carted to safety whenever knocked unconscious while on the job, the study and discovery of fascinating ecosystems and biology would be quite the fun lesson. With creatures as old and unchanged as elders dragons like Alatreon to new and undiscovered species like Xenoj'iiva, the great outdoors and ancient fossils would make for the greatest classroom really.|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend

Unlike the usual education facility that trains you to be a soldier, it doesn't feel like you're going through boot camp. Other than learning the ways of combat, you'll go through classes that cover the history of the nation of Erebonia, along with the other general subjects. The thing that drew me to the place is its environment since the teachers aren't like your typical drill sergeants. Heck, one of them has a tendency to hit the bars frequently. On top of that, she's the best teacher in a video game of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016.|https://www.destructoid.com/|You can't all say the one from Gal*Gun|It's back to school season and we want to know which video game school you'd attend
Aside from its teaching environment, the campus gives me many chances to create my own moments. Whether it's going on a grand fishing adventure with Kenneth Lakelord or encountering supernatural happenings in the Old School House, there's plenty of activities to keep me entertained. If I get assigned to Class VII, then I can go on field trips with Rean and his buddies as we learn about the true issues that affect the country. Best of all, I'll get my own cell phone that lets me cast spells and perform synchronized attacks with my party. During my downtime, I can play the card game called Blade with my senpai who goes by the name of Crow Armbrust.

Ever since Telltale's video game adaptation launched back in 2012, fans have been kept gripped by the story of Clementine, a young girl who is forced to do a hell of a lot of growing up when she is thrust into a nightmarish world of carnivorous walkers, selfish humans, friends, enemies and everyone in-between. Now a young woman, wise and self-sufficient beyond her years, Clementine has reached the end of her story where, alongside AJ - a young boy she rescued during previous seasons - she will finally face her fate.|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 1: Done Running (PC [reviewed], PS4, Xbox One)Developer: Telltale GamesPublisher: Telltale GamesReleased: August 14, 2018MSRP: $19.99/£18.99 (Four episodes)|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
[Minor Spoilers Below]|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
It's worth noting, first and foremost, that Done Running went longer than any episode of a Telltale Game I've played to date, about 30 minutes longer, so it seems that although there are less episodes this season, the overall story should run at the regularly-expected length. The Final Season showcases a new engine with pride, and while there is a definite improvement in graphical fidelity, character models and particularly lighting, movement still bears somewhat awkward animation.|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
"There are also some smoke and mirrors going on here. Although The Final Season boasts a new behind-the-shoulder camera and an overhauled combat system, the gameplay remains as linear as previous Telltale's storytelling titles. The new combat is little more than ""Approach Walker. Activate QTE"" and the new camera still only allows basic control within the small confines of a scene. Done Running does look better than its predecessors, but it really is just a new coat of paint over the same old Telltale gameplay."|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
The Walking Dead's fans are, understandably, mainly here for the character drama. The first episode is quite honestly a bit of a slow-burner. It's mostly character introductions and world-building, as Clem and AJ find themselves part of a community of kids and teenagers, who have carved themselves out a small piece of security from the hellish, Walker-filled landscape. The characters, and their performances, are a little hit-and-miss, and there are some by-the-numbers tropes in full effect. However, it is a quite diverse cast, with some neat and welcome representation. Also, camp-leader Marlon has the best mullet.|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
The focus here, rightly, is on Clementine and AJ, and the former is fantastic. As always, Clem is a resourceful and strong character, remaining both emotionally vulnerable and relatable. Clem is a magnetic lead and it's almost impossible, as the player, not to stand firmly in her corner. AJ is a little more sporadic, due to his inquisitive childish nature and the fact he is still learning about his crazy world, which makes his character a little harder warm to. Over this season, your choices will influence his outlook on the world, and the person he will become.|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
Done Running is mostly a matter of getting to know the new cast of characters we are about to spend several hours with, getting clued up on their thoughts, attitudes, talents and backstories. Most of the action is pretty poor, but things ramp up hard for a great, genuinely shocking finale. It is already apparent that The Walking Dead: The Final Season will just be more of the same, but that's hardly likely to disappoint anyone who has gotten four whole seasons into this adventure.|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running
I'm intrigued to see where the story goes from here, as well as what final fate lies in store for Clementine and AJ. But now the season's setup has been established, it's time to get down to the business of stressful character drama, humourous conversational retorts, and that all-too-nagging feeling that, ultimately, you have minimal control over everything anyway.|https://www.destructoid.com/|It's time for the last stand|Review: The Walking Dead - The Final Season: Done Running

In a somewhat cryptic response to a question about whether or not he would be able to make it to LA for a press event next weekend, Motohiro Okubo might have revealed that Soulcalibur VI has gone gold and is therefore in the final phases before release.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Fate has chosen a large McSouls with a Dr. Pepper|Soulcalibur VI reportedly gone gold, more character and story details teased
While there is no confirmation for this, the timing does make sense with the street release date, just two months away. That's not to say that development has finished on the game though, what with day one patches all but an accepted norm of the industry. There's also an upcoming season pass on the books, which will bring four additional characters to the 17 already announced.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Fate has chosen a large McSouls with a Dr. Pepper|Soulcalibur VI reportedly gone gold, more character and story details teased
But that wasn't all the news from Okubo this weekend. While speaking at the Tokyo Tekken Masters tournament earlier this morning, the producer revealed some details about how the new story mode will play out.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Fate has chosen a large McSouls with a Dr. Pepper|Soulcalibur VI reportedly gone gold, more character and story details teased
Soulcalibur's overarching story has always been a convoluted one, what with non-canon endings in each game and a seemingly overall lack of planning. It looks like the team at Project Soul are trying to fix this issue by going back to before the first Soulcalibur and plotting out a new, interweaving story featuring all of the characters. This can be seen in the new timeline below, which can be somewhat understood even without a translation.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Fate has chosen a large McSouls with a Dr. Pepper|Soulcalibur VI reportedly gone gold, more character and story details teased
Although this timeline was briefly seen in the story trailer posted a few months ago, we weren't allowed to see the full picture at that point. While the timeline shows which characters will possibly interact with each other and where they fall in the main story, it also shows that there are at least five other characters yet to be revealed. Obviously, Namco are keeping those characters close to their chest for future reveals, but if Hilde isn't one of them, then they screwed up.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Fate has chosen a large McSouls with a Dr. Pepper|Soulcalibur VI reportedly gone gold, more character and story details teased
I've got a lot of hope for this game, and frankly after the disaster that was Soulcalibur V and Soulcalibur: Lost Swords the only way this series can go is up. I'll see you on the stage of history when Soulcalibur VI releases for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam on October 18.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Fate has chosen a large McSouls with a Dr. Pepper|Soulcalibur VI reportedly gone gold, more character and story details teased

Thierry Boulanger wears a lot of hats at Sabotage Studio. He’s the co-founder, creative lead, writer, designer, team cheerleader; basically, he’s “the guy.” He’s the guy that’s there to make sure the developer’s first title, The Messenger, is everything Sabotage Studio expects it to be. It needs to be as good as it can be. It needs to be smooth, inviting, and polished. It needs to be able to stand out in the sea of weekly Switch releases. It needs to be something Boulanger is satisfied with because this isn’t just a game to him. It’s the last 25 years of his life. |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
The Messenger, slated for a worldwide release on August 30 on Switch and Steam, is a metroidvania/platformer mash-up inspired by the ninja games of the NES era. It debuted at PAX earlier this year to rave reviews. Our own Rich Meister is so in love with it I’m sure he’d marry the game if he could. All year, it’s been in the ever-growing conversation about indie metroidvanias, usually at the tail end of it. This year has given us some of the greatest the genre has ever seen with titles like Yoku’s Island Express and Dead Cells establishing themselves as legitimate game of the year contenders. From my short time with the game, I think The Messenger has a chance at standing side-by-side with those titles as some of the best games of 2018.|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
"Everything I’ve heard about the game up to this point is true. The graphics? An almost historical representation of the third and fourth generations of console gaming. The music? Criminally catchy. The controls? Tighter than a nun’s anus. Boulanger brought a Switch build for me to try out with stages from the game spliced together with dialogue written specifically for the demo. Extremely self-aware dialogue I should say. The shopkeeper -- gunning for the role of ""2018’s Best New Character"" -- is a riot who continually breaks the fourth wall for a solid joke."|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
The writing is indicative of the rest of the game. It’s absolutely solid all around. Traversal puzzles are organically implemented into the 8-bit/16-bit graphics switch mechanic. Cloud stepping, which gives me the ability to double jump if I hit an enemy or object with my sword, will make this game a speedrunner’s wet dream. I’ve haven’t been this impressed with a throwback title since I first downloaded Shovel Knight four years ago. That title’s been a bell cow for indie platformers over the years and its success gave Boulanger the validation to chase this two-decade-old dream.|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
“I’ve been wanting to make this game since I was eight years old,” he says. “I’ve been thinking about the stories and the characters since I was a kid. It’s been a long time coming. 25 years of my life.”|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
Boulanger created his first demo of the title in 2015. At the beginning of 2017, he and his team at Sabotage Studio entered full production, a dream come true for a guy who just loved playing ninja games growing up. |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
“I’ve always had a thing for ninjas,” Boulanger tells me. “Ninja Gaiden obviously rocked my world when I was young. It’s just – and this is going to sound silly – but I had a thing for what I called jumping into a ball. I just like games where you did front flips when you jumped. I kept looking for these games. If your game has a front flip in it I would play it even if it were terrible. Ninja Gaiden had the coolest front flip when you jumped so I was just all over that.” |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
Ninja Gaiden comes up a lot in our discussion and how can it not. The 8-bit portions of The Messenger feel like levels taken from a never-released Ninja Gaiden IV or a Ninja Gaiden…gaiden. The details I find show a true appreciation for the era, with enemies that respawn if I backtrack to the music that’s a more infectious earworm than a Carly Rae Jepsen hit. The soundtrack is being produced by Rainbowdragoneyes who, as you’re about to find out, takes what he does quite seriously.|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
"""Inauthentic music in a self-proclaimed authentic retro game is the nail in the coffin of authenticity,” he explains in a statement made after my hands-on. “One of them. There’s a few nails actually. The music nail is in particular, a rather large nail. Which is why I thought it important to NAIL the music on the first try, and use tracker programs that are built around the limitations of the NES and Genesis sound chips to create The Messenger’s soundtrack as true to form as possible. It’s not as simple as slapping a 16-bit skin on an “EiGhT bIt MiDi lol” track, nay, each song was programmed in hexadecimal from the ground up, twice. Before you ask me why I like torturing myself, quite honestly the only challenge comes with composing something I’m happy with, which is a struggle no matter what program I use, so if I already wrote it once it’s only a matter of a few (hundred? thousand?) keystrokes to create a second version in a different program. No sweat."" "|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
It’s clearly a lot of effort but the end result is amazing. Switching from 8-bit to 16-bit graphics means a change in music and sound effects as well. The seamless transition is spectacular, even more so when I dive underwater and the music becomes distorted. That’s been a favorite feature of mine since I first heard it in a Mario title and it’s something that will immediately enamor me to a game, much like Boulanger and his love of front flips. |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
My demo of The Messenger ends with a brief but clever boss battle against a short skeleton sorcerer who, like the shopkeeper, manages to elicit a few chuckles before our big bout. It takes me two tries, but I’m able to finish him off and get a quick glimpse at the many levels that await me in the final product. After 25 years of planning and roughly 18 months of development, The Messenger is closer than it’s ever been to finally becoming a reality for Boulanger.|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
“I don’t really know how to feel right now,” he says. “I have to shift to a point of view where I owe it to the team to see it through. I’m looking at the game and I’m in this fortunate position where I’m happy with it. I’m not sitting here wishing we had a bigger budget or anything. I’m one-hundred percent satisfied with what every single team member did. I’m playing the game and it’s genuinely the best we can do. So at this point, we just need to put it out and let the public decide if it’s good enough to let us work on our next game, which obviously would be a second dream come true.” |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
Sabotage isn’t alone in its effort to spread The Messenger to as many fans as possible. After a favorable showing at PAX earlier this year, the game got on the raider of bespoke indie publisher Devolver Digital. With its help, this retro ninja is going global. |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
“They’re amazing,” Boulanger says. “They’re taking us worldwide. We knew we could launch the game in North America and some parts of Europe, but with Devolver, you’re talking Japan, Russia, and other areas where we don’t really understand the markets. They have the means we’re looking for and they really respect us. Devolver has been happy with everything we’ve done and they just want to see what we come up with next.” |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
That next will only come to fruition if The Messenger finds an audience. In my conversation with Boulanger, he explains to me the game that launches at the end of the month is the “leanest” version of the game. The past year and a half has been spent perfecting the campaign and that’s what players will get when it hits digital storefronts. That’s eight to ten hours of game, a solid chunk for the genre. |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
I ask about additional modes, such as time attack or boss rush, as well as the possibility of a physical edition. Boulanger says he’d like all of those to become a reality, but it’ll all depend on how the game is received. For many games, success is a matter of timing and on Switch, it can be difficult to predict when is the correct time to launch given the average week sees roughly two dozen titles hit the platform. I ask Boulanger if he’s at all worried about competition on the eShop.|https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
“Worried? A bit. It’s not like we won’t do it, but it’s certainly a lot more crowded than it used to be. When we put out the trailer we were fortunate enough to get a lot of views on it and basically, every second comment was ‘Can we get this on Switch?’ It’s a meme now, but the demand is there. We think it feels right. It’s what they want to see, what they want to play on Switch. From my dim point of view, you always have people asking ‘Do zombie games do well? Do mobile games do well? Do AAA games do well?‘ I think the only thing that consistently does well is a game with high polish. That’s what we’re shooting for.” |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
Polish this game has in spades. It’s one of the more sophisticated and fine-tuned experiences I’ve had the pleasure of previewing. As a semi-professional games blogger, I can’t wait to see the public reaction to it. As a 20-year fan of the genre, I can’t wait to explore every nook and cranny of The Messenger. Metroidvanias may be ubiquitous among indie developers, but there’s a reason for that; a reason that will change depending on whom you ask. |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
“I don’t know if it’ll make sense, but my personal take on it is there is a drive to set the world straight. With metroidvanias, it’s not just traversing areas and killing monsters. It’s really about restoring balance. There’s trouble here so I set it straight and now I can go back to this other area where there was trouble and fix it. It think it’s like by playing the game, you intrinsically feel like you’re doing something right, something good, something that has an impact and is rewarding. You’re not just yourself surviving but you’re fixing something that’s bigger than you.” |https://www.destructoid.com/|The last great game of August?|We talk ninja flips, metroidvanias, and the 25-year journey of The Messenger with creator Thierry Boulanger
The Messenger will launch worldwide on August 30. Pre-loading is available right now in North America and will become an option for European Switch owners next week. The game will retail for $19.99.

Growing up, I didn't really play a whole lot of adventure or point and click games. For starters, I didn't have a PC and there wasn't a ton really available for consoles. And compared to stuff like Sonic the Hedgehog or NBA Jam, adventure games just looked boring; I was far more concerned with action than clever writing or an engaging narrative.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
Now that I'm older (and allegedly wiser), I feel like I can more readily appreciate narrative over action, and it's games like Wailing Heights that really showcase how rewarding adventure games can be.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights

Wailing Heights tells the story of Frances Finklestein, producer of the legendary 60s pop band The Deadbeats. Following the death of the final remaining band member, Finklestein gets a call to produce a remembrance for the band, setting him off to the studio. On the way, things go awry and he finds himself in the eponymous town of Wailing Heights, inhabited entirely by the souls of dead people who have been reincarnated as either a ghost, vampire, werewolf, or zombie. From there, Finklestein must figure out his purpose in this town over the next seven or so hours.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
As it's more or less a classic adventure game, you'll be spending most of your time in Wailing Heights crossing back and forth across the map talking to the inhabitants of the titular town, performing various tasks and solving riddles for them to collect artifacts and clues to advance the story. The game does feature one gameplay twist in a possession mechanic; once you meet key characters, you must learn the one thing they truly love and the one they truly hate, upon which time you can possess them in order to use their special abilities or have different interactions with NPCs.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
Each monster type has their own ability to use. Ghosts can become invisible to read thoughts, vampires can turn into bats and fly to reach higher spots, werewolves can track scent trails in their wolf form, and zombies can...uh...zombie-walk and understand other zombies. It's this possession mechanic that puts a different spin on the typical adventure gameplay, giving some pretty clever and hilarious puzzles to solve.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
Unfortunately, the gameplay does fall into some standard genre pitfalls. For instance, there are several times where the game expects you to talk to a certain NPC with a certain possessed character in a certain order -- all without giving you much by means of a clue as to why. This ambiguity sometimes works for it as you solve a riddle, slap your head, and wonder why you didn't think of it before, but also goes the other way in making you wonder how you could have possibly known the solution based on the situation. And having to talk to people multiple times with different characters often leads to hearing the same dialogue over and over again. It's fun to explore the town and meet its strange denizens; it's not fun to have them tell you the same thing multiple times as you try to figure out exactly what the game wants you to do.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
Luckily, the game does have an organic hint system in the werewolf's ability to trace scents. It points you in the direction you need to go without being as obvious as a simple hint system in the pause menu. It's a clever little touch that offers just enough to grease the wheels without outright telling you what to do.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
For most adventure games, the gameplay itself comes second to the writing, and let me tell you this game is superb in that regard -- it is absolutely oozing with personality and humor. The dialogue is extremely punny and snappy, the character interactions are genuine and fun, and the story itself takes some really rewarding turns. I gotta say, I didn't expect the twist the game took at the end, and I don't think I could have enjoyed it more; it left a huge smile on my face as I watched the end credits roll, and I actually wanted to go back and play it again right after I beat it. That's something I almost never do with games.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
Even better than the story is the music. As a spooky rock-opera, the game is centered around music and it absolutely nails that aspect. Several musical genres are represented here, from hip-hop to jazz to folk, and all are competent at worst, and absolutely delightful at best. What drew me to this game in the first place is the theme song found in the trailer, which sounds like it could be from a niche copycat band of The Beatles or The Monkees, so I was really pleased that the music in the game as a whole is just as catchy and authentic. And since each character has a theme song that plays when you switch back and forth, you'll get to hear them a lot. I know a lot of people like to listen to game soundtracks outside of playing the game because it moved them so much, and I've never been able to connect with a game's music like that, myself -- that is, until now.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
To top the whole thing off, the visuals are just as appealing. I'm a huge fan of monsters and Halloween-y type stuff, so the beautiful and low-level-spooky hand-drawn art really spoke to me. Even if you're not as enthralled by the subject matter as I am, the visuals are still crisp and appealing, and even the sometimes-wonky animation is super cute and charming. My only real complaint in this field is the cutscenes are largely just comic panels, and sometimes don't quite pop as well as the visuals featured in-game. But all in all, the game is just as fun to look at as it is to hear and play.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights
I thought the game looked kind of silly and fun when I first saw it, but I honestly didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. Sure, it was frustrating at times as I ran around the town with each character trying to trigger the one specific thing I needed to do to advance the story, and yeah there are some minor bugs that cause your characters to freeze or disappear behind some level architecture. But after the game was over, I had forgotten most of my previous complaints and found that I had legitimately enjoyed playing it. This has somehow become one of my favorite games, and I couldn't be happier about that.|https://www.destructoid.com/|We are The Deadbeats|Review: Wailing Heights

On the game shelf in my room, there exist some of the greatest video games of this generation. Titles like Nioh, Shadow of the Colossus, Gravity Rush 2, Uncharted 4, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for Switch, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2. They sit largely unplayed, maybe a couple dozen minutes spent with each title here and there. It's not because I don't want to play them or that I don't have the time. In fact, despite working a full-time job and doing all the preview and interviews I do for this site, I have more time than ever before. They're sitting there because every day after work when I need the stress of life to fall from my shoulders, I'm not killing orcs or shooting up enemy encampments. Instead, I'm taking the BR Class 43 HST from Slough to Ealing Broadway in Train Sim World.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
I've never been a train person. I don't remember ever owning a Thomas the Tank Engine set as a child though I'm sure I did as it's one of those toys that always finds its way into children's bedrooms. I do remember the first time I rode a train, though. It was through the forests of Washington. My family and I were on a day trip and the folks thought it would be a fun family activity. I remember sitting there, looking out as the trees moved slowly by, the light peeking through the canopy illuminating the stream a few yards from the tracks. It's a lovely image, but it's not when a fascination with trains began to bubble. That wouldn't happen until Animal Crossing.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
The opening of that landmark title, where Rover chats me up on my way to my new, takes place on a train, and a pleasant one at that. For all the years of train levels in platformers, shooters, and that steam engine you suplex in Final Fantasy VI, this would be the first time I would appreciate the marvel of the locomotive. That appreciation only grew with games like The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks, Ticket to Ride, Resident Evil 0, Paper Mario: Color Splash, and now Train Sim World.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
My curiosity to give this game a go actually began with a contest we had here on Destructoid giving away copies of Bus Simulator 18. I had a chuckle at the concept of a game having you do nothing but drive a bus and laughed out loud when I saw this series has been going strong since 2010. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was just another form of those great, relaxing, melt-the-day-away titles that I played after finals in college. Fishing games and the sort. Those weren't the experiences I usually dabbled in, but when I didn't want to focus on something overwhelming, they fit the bill for what it was I needed.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
I honestly thought I was over needing those kinds of experiences a few years ago, but the past three weeks with Train Sim World have proven that to be incorrect. From Dovetail Games, Train Sim World is available now on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 and features three major routes from across the world: the Great Western Express in England, the S-Bahn railways of Germany, and the Northeast Corridor in New York and New Jersey. Each route features different engines to take control of, such as the A Class 166 and the BR Class 66.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
Though each different type of train has a unique control panel, they all feature coordinated controls. So what makes me stop and go in one train will work the same way for all of them. Getting a handle on how everything operated in the game took roughly an hour going through all of the tutorials and since then, I've been familiarizing myself with the quirks and qualities of each engine. Braking continues to be my biggest issue, especially on those transit runs, but the game is only ever overly punishing if I completely screw up a scenario.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
That lack of correction when I don't make it to a stop on schedule or I blow through a caution light at 75 miles per hour is what has allowed me to simply relax with this game. I ride the train every day to work and it's never on time and always over capacity. Coming home to Train Sim World lets me experience almost a fantasy world where train travel is pleasant for me and where the world passing by can be enjoyed without having to peek between heads.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
It has to be relaxing because, for many of the scenarios in the game, there isn't that much for me to do. In one, I literally start the train and drive for 45 miles, all in real time. The only moments where I have to pay attention are right at the beginning and roughly five miles out from the destination. That's 40 miles of sitting back in a calm, almost meditative stupor. |https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
I don't even have to drive the train if I want to remove the remote possibility of stress in this unwind gaming session. Train Sim World features a passenger mode where I can just ride the train, enjoying the scenery between Paddington and Reading, taking pictures at my leisure. The game even features the actual schedule these trains operate on as well as adjustable weather, giving me the option to sit blissfully by as the snow falls between New Rochelle and the Newark Airport.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
Train Sim World's only faults lie in its lack of ambition. These routes just aren't enough, especially when you ignore the many more exotic tracks found in India, China, and Japan. Also, on my PS4 Slim, it doesn't make the best use of Unreal Engine 4. The scenery can't always keep up with the pace of the train, it's easy to see unfinished towns and forests in the distance, and the world is incredibly sparse of people despite these being three of the busiest train routes in the world. Oh, and the controls don't always work and scenario instructions aren't always the clearest.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World
But besides all that, the lack of Asian and Indian train routes is, for a game that prides itself on its features that let players take a back seat and just enjoy the world they're in, a missed opportunity. Perhaps with DLC down the line, we could see something new, something to really show off a place more brilliant in color than soggy old Germany, England, and New Jersey. I have just one more scenario to complete to do everything the game has to offer, and the serenity this game has brought me over these past few stressful weeks has been a blessing. As we enter the busy season for game releases and reviews, I know I'll be falling back into it whenever it all becomes too much.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Meditative gaming|Seeking serenity in Train Sim World

It's a lot easier to find amazing fan creations from a series like Zelda.

While watching one of the Indiana Jones films, have you ever stopped to think how unlikely it is that Indy succeeds all the time? What are the chances he knows exactly which items to use in remote locations around the world at the exact right time? How can he stroll into ancient ruins, step on pressure plates, and narrowly avoid death all the time? Since it looks so easy in film, many of us have thought we could do the same thing. Those daring feats of cunning wit and narrow escapes look so enticing that it shouldn’t be so difficult, right?|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
If you’ve ever believed you could be Indiana Jones, playing the cult-classic La-Mulana would quickly put you in your place. This is a game not afraid to erase hours of progress for failing to pay attention and one with clues so cryptic a blind playthrough could take upwards of 100 hours. While it was never a massive commercial success, La-Mulana gained a big enough following to Kickstart a sequel and show us that, yeah, being Indiana Jones ain’t that easy.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
I just wish the whole thing was polished better because my struggles with reaching the conclusion aren’t purely down to my lacking spatial awareness.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
La-Mulana 2 (PC [reviewed], Xbox One) Developer: Nigoro Publisher: AGM Playism Released: July 30, 2018 (PC), TBA (Xbox One) MSRP: $24.99|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
I’ll be upfront about this and tell you all that I haven’t finished La-Mulana 2. I’ve put around 30 hours into the game and have made steady progress, but not without a complete restart to get myself back on track. One of the joys of La-Mulana is how little it cares about your mental well-being, so you can accidentally activate a hard mode that is irreversible. Despite knowing this sly trick, I somehow did it in the sequel and needed to begin anew after putting 17 hours into a playthrough.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
That being said, it gave me a great understanding of how diverse playthroughs of La-Mulana 2 can be. Using the help of some guides for my second run, I was able to fast track my way to the guardians (the main bosses) with little effort and recover my entire inventory in around two hours. From there, I’ve been looking to the unofficial La-Mulana 2 subreddit and checking out videos about how to acquire items and am surprised at how differently I went about things my first run through. You can take some wildly different routes and acquire items much earlier than you need to, which is likely to make the speedrunning community very happy.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
On the flip side, this open-ended approach often means you’ll stumble into dead ends and be left with little clue of how to progress. Even with semi-nonlinearity, there are certain items and bosses you need to vanquish to reach late game areas and it can be a real struggle to even decipher what the game wants of you. I feel dumb about some of the puzzle solutions, but others are so stupidly complicated that it feels like the game is built for people with hyper-intelligence.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
This would all be fine if the combat didn’t also mercilessly stomp you when you’re down. After explaining to my friend how brutal La-Mulana 2 is, I proceeded to find a new area and locate a save point. Since you can fast travel to save points, I was very eager to read the grail and activate my new warp point, but the floor collapsed right in front of me as I was walking and dropped me into a bed of spikes.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
This uncompromising difficulty also applies to enemy encounters. Your invincibility frames after taking damage are so minuscule that you’ll often get juggled between foes and land on top of spikes that can wipe your health out in seconds. Nothing eases up on you in La-Mulana 2 and that is likely to put a majority of gamers off from the get-go.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
A lot of this isn’t new for the series, though. People who have dipped their toes in the original game know how ridiculously difficult it can be. I’ve seen the phrase “Dark Souls before Dark Souls” online, but that isn’t entirely accurate. At least Dark Souls cares about your sanity; La-Mulana just kicks the shit out of you and forces you to play by its rules. There are no hacks, tricks or easy shortcuts in its world.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
Well, that should be true, but the main problem that troubles me with La-Mulana 2 is how buggy it can be. I’m not sure if this was an issue with the remake of the original (I played it in 2015 after it had been out for three years), but I’ve seen a variety of stages in La-Mulana 2 and they all have some problem with them. The pre-release version was missing some content and had incorrect translations (leading to an endgame puzzle that was literally impossible to solve). You could also glitch your way to items way earlier than intended, which ended up breaking the game in ways developer Nigoro probably didn’t want. Even with those bugs squashed, this current version has graphical glitches and some oddly stiff controls at times.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
To make matters worse, the launch version was actually easier than the build currently available online. I can’t speak from experience, but there is a pretty vocal group of fans that were displeased with the final boss in the launch version because of how simple it was. Now, the boss is a nightmare of precise timing and acute pattern recognition. I’ve noticed general enemy encounters are just tougher and even bosses I previously conquered put up a challenge on my second attempt. I commend developer Nigoro for listening to fans, but I can’t deny I have a feeling that La-Mulana 2 was a bit rushed.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
The general presentation in La-Mulana 2 is better than the first, but there are odd sprite scaling problems that result in ugly tearing while moving across wider rooms. Sometimes I’ll press the jump button before reaching an edge, but my character won’t respond in time and walk straight off. Other times, still, I’ll get stuck in damage loops that then result in me getting kicked to the previous screen and wasting time. Even some room specific triggers won’t set off, requiring you reload your save to make progress. It can be a ridiculously frustrating experience.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
At the same time, I’ll be exploring some areas and listening to the music and just enter a zen state. The soundtrack is beyond excellent and somehow manages to surpass the original. It often makes me think La-Mulana 2 is the best game ever created. I love how diverse the environments are and how stage gimmicks start to become a bigger focus in the latter half. The various upgrades available to you feel like tangible improvements and do more than Metroid’s various ammo upgrades ever could. It is a masterclass in how to properly upgrade your character while keeping older items relevant.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
It’s just the difficulty balancing doesn’t feel correct. Clearly, the first boss will be hard because of how unfamiliar you are with the game, but I shouldn’t be steamrolling the fifth one after the fourth gave me nightmares. I shouldn’t enter an area called “Dark Lord’s Mausoleum” and never feel threatened. Everything is fun to explore, but there isn’t a clear sense of progression in how these areas are laid out or which path you should be going in.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
For that matter, a lot of the solutions to puzzles require an obscene amount of backtracking to deal with. You’ll find a clue in one area that triggers the puzzle in another while requiring you to obtain an item from a third area and it feels like brain surgery. This game is so obtuse, at times, that I just want to scream. It doesn’t help that you can die immediately if you make a wrong move, which then requires you to repeat the process however many times.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
Still, I haven’t given up on La-Mulana 2. It may drive me nuts and lead me to an early grave, but I’m compelled to keep playing. I want to see that conclusion and may even just speedrun the title after beating it to empower myself. I could even give hard mode a proper shot, though I don’t know if I’m ready to give up seeing my friends and family for a whole month. The game has its hooks in me and I’m eager to discover its secrets, but it certainly is not easy.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
I just don’t feel comfortable giving it a score under these circumstances. For the people who do gel with the decidedly old-school flavor that La-Mulana is, 2 is going to be an absolute joy for them. For the ones that want a little more guidance or hate “wasting” time due to unforeseen insta-deaths, La-Mulana 2 is going to be an absolute nightmare. Does that mean I give the game a one and a 10 at the same time?|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
Maybe my own opinion will change after the credits roll, but I honestly don’t think so. Rating La-Mulana 2 anything doesn’t do the game justice. There are issues with it and some odds and ends could be tightened up, but even if it pales in comparison to the first (which I don’t personally believe), fans will likely still be talking about this game for years to come. This is an experience that doesn’t come around often in any medium.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2
So if you believe you’re ready to take the plunge on a journey that just might end you, La-Mulana 2 is highly recommended. Just be sure to look out for false tablets…and don’t stand still too often…oh, definitely listen when the game tells you to stop reading.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Eg-Lana awaits|Review: La-Mulana 2

If everyone's expectations are correct, Nvidia will officially reveal its newest video cards on Monday August 20 at 9am Pacific. While there has been rampant speculation for quite a while now, it seems as if the cat is officially out of the bag. Nvidia will follow the 10 series of GPUs with a 20 series.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Not the 11 series like everyone thought|Nvidia expected to unveil RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti video cards next week
The most confident reporting comes from VideoCardz, who claims that it has the finalized specs for both the RTX 2080 Ti and the RTX 2080 -- the two cards that Nvidia will announce. The 2080 Ti is an absolute beast. It has 11GB of GDDR6 memory with 4352 CUDA cores. That's the same amount of dedicated video RAM (although GDDR6 instead of GDDR5X) as the GTX 1080 Ti, which is Nvidia's closest already-available competing card. But, that's a 20 percent increase in CUDA cores over the 1080 Ti.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Not the 11 series like everyone thought|Nvidia expected to unveil RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti video cards next week
As for the RTX 2080, it's a similar kind of upgrade over the GTX 1080. It'll come with 8GB of GDDR6 (as does the 1080 but with GDDR5X), and it's said to have 2944 CUDA cores. That's a 15 percent increase over the 1080. Both of these cards will be based on the Turing architecture, rather than the Pascal architecture of the 10 series.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Not the 11 series like everyone thought|Nvidia expected to unveil RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti video cards next week
Aside from the fact that there are new GPUs, two particularly interesting things are happening here. First, Nvidia is revealing its base model and the Ti edition at the same time. In the past, the Ti edition has released months or even a year later as a sort of half-step upgrade before announcing an entirely new series. Also, it seems like the RTX series will get rid of SLI support to bridge multiple video cards. Nvidia announced its new Quadro cards earlier this week, which are its cards for professional graphics work. Quadro will implement a physical connector called NVLink, and it's likely that the RTX gaming cards will follow suit.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Not the 11 series like everyone thought|Nvidia expected to unveil RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti video cards next week
We'll know more on Monday morning when Nvidia hosts its gamescom event. It's likely that we'll get final confirmation on these GPUs and their specs, along with release dates and prices. Then, all the third-party manufacturers like ASUS, Gigabyte, and EVGA should announce their individual models shortly thereafter. I'll leave you with this MSI RTX 2080 Ti that leaked.

The first-person dungeon crawler transformed for me once I was introduced to Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey on the Nintendo DS. Before SMT, my experience was with ruthlessly difficult titles such as Might and Magic and Wizardry, which were incredibly unfriendly starting points to the genre.

Mary Skelter: Nightmares is thoroughly steeped in the elements of this genre which has been beaten like a dead horse and practically saturates the PS Vita, the platform it was originally ported from.

I want to get the bad parts out of the way -- namely, the story. Look, these games are made for a particular crowd, and I will happily recognize that what may be droll and grating for me will be someone else's wonderful guilty pleasure. If you are an anime fan, and have played and enjoyed titles such as Dungeon Travelers 2, what is on offer here will probably be acceptable to you. Many of these games feel extraordinarily similar in their tropes and stereotypes. While something like Strange Journey and to a lesser extent Stranger of Sword City offered a very off-color, doom-filled aesthetic, separating them from the cutesier titles in the lot, Mary Skelter sort of rides the line right in the middle.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
You are Jack, a little boy without a backbone surrounded by far more interesting women characters based on different fairytale stories such as Red Riding Hood and Sleeping Beauty. There is an affection gauge you can build with each one (because of course there is). Part of the plot revolves around a blood and “licking” mechanic...and I feel like I have to say very little else about this, or how when the girls go into “massacre mode,” they are stripped down to nothing in the process. This is ecchi at its most chef-kissing perfection, if that’s your jam.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
It’s somewhat reserved in this regard compared to other games, and thankfully, the primary focus is the dungeon crawling because the story is a mediocre and boring mess which primarily exists to introduce the nine hundred little micro-mechanics the game expects you to learn. Dialogue trees go on for way too long and are uninteresting, and the characters equally so. You are trapped in a living jail when the story begins, infested by Marchens, the game's various enemy types.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
With your team of aforementioned Blood Maidens, you have to explore this giant prison and destroy different Nightmares, powerful boss monsters who roam freely throughout the mazes and pursue you mercilessly, sometimes even ambushing you while you are already in battle similar to FOEs in Etrian Odyssey, but executed a bit differently. Once locked in battle with these creatures, all you can do is stun them to escape -- they will usually one-shot members of your party otherwise. Once you have completed a dungeon, they can be faced head on and defeated, though even this is a tough prospect; Mary Skelter: Nightmares is no cake walk.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
 All of the story here is a means to an end, and that end is excellent dungeon crawling. Coupled with the Nightmare mechanic, there are puzzles strewn throughout the interconnected mazes, which are often massive in scale. There may be one or two too many fiddly mechanics, with Jack serving as sort of an untouchable permanent back-row member of your party who is unable to fight. He's resigned to managing the Maidens, defending them and using items to heal them, and making sure their Blood Meter does not fill up or become too corrupt, which can lead to the undesired effect of them going into Massacre Mode. If that happens, they essentially go berserk and do major damage to foes and allies alike, which is sometimes an interesting and risky trump card to play if things are going south.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
The less powerful Blood Skelter mode the ladies can go into if their gauge fills up acts as a sort of limit break, accessing additional skills and causing their attacks to do more damage for a turn, and the ladies can lick one another when they have a partial or nearly full meter to bring the meter of their oral fixation back to zero and gain some HP and SP healing and other buff effects. With all this at play, even small battles can feel very engaging. There is always something to manage.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
 The dungeon crawling is positively addictive. A highly flexible skill point allocation system and a ton of equipment customization through enhancements meant I spent a long time just messing around in menus -- something I am quite fond of in dungeon crawlers, where the characters to me are just custom stat blocks. There is a class system as well, as if there weren’t enough variety in the unique skills of each Maiden. After the first couple of dungeon levels, Mary Skelter: Nightmares distances itself from simpler blobber affairs by evolving into a neat little sandbox of tinkering.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
The jail being alive adds yet another element of randomization with certain buffs available if you fill up the jail's hunger, lust, and sleep meters (just...don’t worry about it, it all makes sense in context, I’m sure.). This gives the dungeon itself a personality past being another series of mazes, however thinly veiled said themes happen to be.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
The game is fairly forgiving in its systems as well. Dungeons are connected to one another allowing for easy movement in between and out of them, and an early ability one of the girls has is to place a portal out of the dungeon for a very small amount of SP. You can freely exit the dungeon using this skill at just about any time, and save just about anywhere, but if you go back you will need to travel through the maze again to return to the point you left. That said, if this sounds repetitive or grindy and that bothers you, you’re better off playing something else. Mary Skelter: Nightmares fully embraces its dungeon-crawling roots, and is unapologetic about them, and I loved it.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
Mary Skelter: Nightmares therefore treads fun but ultimately familiar water. There is something about it which strikes me as different from other titles in the genre, and the amount of tweaking you can do to build a unique party is welcome. It’s a fun, competent RPG with a unique presentation, but I would approach with caution if you absolutely can’t stomach another dungeon crawler.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares
It kept me engaged and having fun throughout, apart from when I was skipping dialogue trees as quickly as possible to preserve my own sanity. It’s a great blobber despite a dull story, and was fun enough to warrant hitting the “skip” button several thousand times in order to get back into the action.|https://www.destructoid.com/|A bloody good blobber|Review: Mary Skelter: Nightmares

And just like that, the weekend is upon us, arriving with the welcoming face of an old friend, or at least one which won't drop a pile of work onto your desk. For many of you, this means two days of rest, relaxation and good times. Others, unfortunately may still be dragging themselves up and heading off to work. We hear you, and we look forward to you coming back home tonight.I didn't get much played this week that's outside of the (loot) box, given that Overwatch is in the midst of its Summer Games spectacular. But damn if Arcade isn't suffering because of it. With only five spaces, and not one but two taken up by the tepid Lucioball (and one seemingly perpetually on Eight Player Deathmatch), that just leaves rotating crap like Low Gravity. I've been forced to play actual, normal Overwatch! Can you believe that?I also stepped back into the ring - not in real life, those days are long gone - but in Spike Chunsoft's Fire Pro Wrestling World which now, on Steam, has about a bazillion downloadable characters. FPW is a great wrasslin' game, but as I've said many times before, you can't just pick it up and let rip, you only get out of Fire Pro what you put into it. Still, it's gotten me set for tonight's NXT Takeover, where I'll sit and sob heavily as my two favourites, Shayna Baszler and Kairi Sane, make mincemeat out of each other for the NXT Championship.But that's enough about me. What have you beautiful people being playing this week? You can't still all be rocking Yakuza 0, surely everyone has completed that by now. Perhaps you took a chance on We Happy Few, or hit the kitchens with Overcooked 2. Whatever you've been hitting this week, let us know below, we love hearing about it.Have a wonderful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Rocking the Ring|Whatcha been playing this week, Destructoid?
That's one of those headlines where it feels criminal to hone on just one thing. Generation Zero has a lot going for it. It's an '80s-themed cooperative survival shooter where you and your friends trek around the deserted Swedish countryside fighting off packs of robot hunters.|https://www.destructoid.com/|First look at gameplay|Fight the robot apocalypse in Sweden with your pals in Generation Zero
Generation Zero is the third, lesser-talked-about project that Avalanche Studios is working on right now (Just Cause 4, Rage 2). The video that's embedded above is the first proper look at its gameplay; all we got at E3 was an announcement trailer that introduced the premise and setting.|https://www.destructoid.com/|First look at gameplay|Fight the robot apocalypse in Sweden with your pals in Generation Zero
While it bills itself as a survival shooter, Generation Zero is just as much about tactics as it's about survival. As this video explains, there are different ways to approach combat, and thinking it through is usually the best idea. For instance, you can shoot nearby electronics to shock the robots (or throw a boom box trap) and easily dismantle them. Also, the fewer bullets you put into a robot, the more parts you'll be able to salvage. |https://www.destructoid.com/|First look at gameplay|Fight the robot apocalypse in Sweden with your pals in Generation Zero
Even though Generation Zero has four-player cooperative, everyone doesn't necessarily need to play as a group. This open world doesn't tether anyone together, and they're all free to explore Sweden at their leisure (and peril). However, that could also useful for pinching enemies and attacking from both the front and behind. Generation Zero employs a soft class system where players can kind of lean toward specializations as they see fit, rather than picking a role and sticking to it.|https://www.destructoid.com/|First look at gameplay|Fight the robot apocalypse in Sweden with your pals in Generation Zero
Generation Zero will launch on PC, PS4, and Xbox One in 2019. But, there's an opportunity to experience it sooner. There will be a closed beta this fall, which you can sign up for on the game's site.|https://www.destructoid.com/|First look at gameplay|Fight the robot apocalypse in Sweden with your pals in Generation Zero
It's always a treat when games aren't afraid to get a little silly and experiment with side content. In the latest Warframe update, Digital Extremes has added Frame Fighter, an arcade fighting mini-game.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Frame Fighter|You can now turn Warframe into a fighting game

Rocket League has existed in its current state for more than three years now, and developer Psyonix has stayed mostly hands-off with the minutiae of how everything works. It's nearly the exact same game that launched in July 2015. That's why it's so Capital A1 Wild that players keep finding new mechanics to implement on a semi-regular(ish) basis.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
"The newest one is being called a ""ground reset"" by the community, at least for now. Explaining it requires a bit of technical backstory. In Rocket League, you have two jumps every time you leave the ground. The first jump gets you airborne, and then you have approximately 1.5 seconds to use the second jump. If you don't use it, it's gone until you land on the ground again."|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
For the longest time, players have worked on intricate ways to exploit when and how they use their jumps. There are two widely-accepted methods. Falling off the ceiling means that the first jump is never used. That leads to players preserving their jump/dodge for as long as they want, so they can flick into the ball for a surprise shot on goal at any point. Ceiling shots have become a big part of the high-level Rocket League meta in the past year or so.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
The other method is more in-line with how the ground reset works. Jumps are restored anytime all four of the car's wheels touch a surface. Most times it's used on the ground when landing. But, skilled players can earn flip resets by carefully positioning the vehicle to touch all its wheels on the ball while both are in the air. This gives back both jumps/dodges that, again, usually get used for an unpredictable shot on goal.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
The ground reset is a way to get in the air purely off of the car's forward momentum. It requires a forward wavedash-like thing and then boosting to get liftoff. When done correctly, the player should have a flick that isn't on a timer because all four wheels touch down for just a split second before going airborne. The video that's embedded above is from Helvetia, who's the inventor of this technique. It best explains the nuances of the mechanic.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
The big drawback is that the ground reset is a boost hog. It takes most of a full boost gauge to get reasonably high. But, it's a third method for flying through the sky with a flick up your sleeve. Right now, it's a neat mechanic that doesn't seem like it has too many practical applications. We'll see what happens in a few months. Nearly every other mechanic has been efficiently adapted and put into the best players' bag of tricks. The same could easily happen with the ground reset.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
But, really, it's just so cool that people keep finding new ways to manipulate Rocket League's physics.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Introducing the ground reset|Rocket League players found a new mechanic three years after launch
In case you missed it, Bethesda and id Software showed off the debut footage of Doom Eternal on stage during QuakeCon 2018's keynote. It was a massive presentation that lasted nearly half an hour -- and given that it was in the middle of the work day and was broadcasted on Twitch, it makes perfect sense that some of you might be in the dark. But lo and behold one week later, Bethesda's YouTube channel has an easily digestible video for you that you can view below.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Roughly 25 minutes worth|Doom Eternal's QuakeCon footage is now easily viewable on YouTube
"To recap, Doom Eternal is retaining mostly the same production team and following closely in the footsteps of Doom 2016. Developer id Software is keen to dive further into the Doom mythology beyond what they already built, showcasing new locations other than Mars and Hell (which are yet to be named) and a mysterious relationship between the ""Slayer"" protagonist (Doom Guy) and at least one new enemy."|https://www.destructoid.com/|Roughly 25 minutes worth|Doom Eternal's QuakeCon footage is now easily viewable on YouTube
"Our hero will also sport some new tricks like a grappling hook and more melee capabilities, as well as new weaponry to battle a bunch of additional foes. Foes, mind, that also include a multiplayer ""Invasion"" style mechanic that can be toggled off."|https://www.destructoid.com/|Roughly 25 minutes worth|Doom Eternal's QuakeCon footage is now easily viewable on YouTube
Doom Eternal currently has no launch date, but we do have confirmed platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch.|https://www.destructoid.com/|Roughly 25 minutes worth|Doom Eternal's QuakeCon footage is now easily viewable on YouTube
